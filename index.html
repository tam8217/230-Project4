        <h1 id="title">Animation Station</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome to Animation Station! Here, you'll be able to make a shape and play around with it in various ways. For the full experieince, start with Phase 1, and continue onto Phase 2 and 3. Otherwise, you will be using a default shape, rather than one created by you!</p>
        
        

        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <p>In Phase 1, you will create your own shape which you will use in Phases 2 and 3. Making a shape is easy! Once inside Phase 1, you'll see sets of buttons; try changing one! Once you've made one that you like, you can move on. From here, you can go to either Phase 2 or 3, whichever you like. Don't worry, your shape will still be there, and even if you leave and come back, it will be waiting for you! Feel free to return to Phase 1 at any time to make a new shape. </p>
        <p>If you're ready, let's get started!</p>
        <button id="p1But"><a href="phase1.html">Phase 1</a></button>

        <h3>Phase 2</h3>
        <p>In Phase 2, you'll get to throw your shape around the screen! When you load into Phase 2, your shape will form itself, and come at rest in the bottom right of the screen. Next to it you'll see the 'launching mechanism'. As you move either of the sliders, you'll see your shape move too; you can move them as much or as little as you like. When you've 'set' your shape, press the fire button and watch your shape fly! To bring it back, simply move one of the sliders again.</p>
        <button id="p2But"><a href="phase2.html">Phase 2</a></button>

        <h3>Phase 3</h3>
        <p>In Phase 3, you can sit back and watch your shape move. When the page loads, you will see the initial shape being drawn; this is a random shape. Your shape will then form, and begin to follow a path in the shape of the random path. When you get tired of the current shape, press the button, and the current path will morph into a new one, which your shape will then follow. </p>
        <button id="p3But"><a href="phase3.html">Phase 3</a></button>
