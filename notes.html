            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <h3>Primary Library</h3>
            <p>The main library that made this site possible is <a href="animejs.com">anime.js.</a> It is a library that revolves around animating 
            different elements on a page in smooth and unique ways. It is what allowed for the vanishing menus on Phase 1, the entirety of 
            Phase 2, as well as the path following and drawing on Phase 3.</p>

            <h3>Additional Libraries</h3>
            <p>I also implemented <a href="https://jqueryui.com/">jQueryUI</a>, a branch of <a href="jquery.com">jQuery</a>. JQueryUI allowed
            for smooth transitions between switching classes, as used on Phase 1; the Switch Class function of jQueryUI was incredibly helpful
            for that. It also made it much easier to make classes appear on the home page.</p>
            
            <h3>Tutorials/Code Utilized</h3>
            <p>The gradient lines were taken from these sites: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/forums/topic/sexy-css3-fading-line/">CSS-Tricks</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/tylergaw/2417036">Github Gists</a>, and additional help came from  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp">W3 Schools</a>.</p>
            <p>The styled sliders came from this W3 Schools https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp. This also helped guide
                me as to how to make slider input change the position of the shape in Phase 2.</p> 
            <p>SVG creation and workings came from Morten Rand-Hendriksen's tutorial on <a href="https://www.lynda.com/SVG-tutorials/Draw-polygon/622089/658126-4.html?org=rit.edu">Lynda.com</a></p>
            <p>Most of the animations using anime.js were created with the help of , or modifications on, their demos on their <a href="http://animejs.com/documentation/">documentation page</a>.</p>
            <h3>Fonts</h3>
            <p>Both of the fonts used for this website came from Google Fonts. The headings are <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald">Oswald</a>, while the body text is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a></p>
            
            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p>
                Becuase of the use of SVGs in Phase 3, if the CSS for the site is validated without CSS3 + SVG, it will throw errors.
                When checked with CSS3 + SVG, the site encounters no errors. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Above and Beyond</h2>
            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <p>Although we did an out of class exercise on local storage, I needed to relearn how to use it, as well as how to properly implement
                it. This is what allowed for the same shape to carry over between different pages, even between sessions. 
            </p>
            <p>Another obvious point of learning was the capabilities of anime.js. The documentation provided for the library is quite detailed,
                but testing was still necessary to figure out how to achieve desired animations and movements. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the harder parts of this project was learning how to do random generation of SVGs. We briefly learned how SVGs worked, but procedural,
                on the fly generation was not in that lesson. Morton Rand-Hendriksen's tutorial on Lynda.com talking about how to draw polygonal SVGs 
                is where I got most my information for this topic. This also involved getting a basic grasp of the Math class in JavaScript so I could
                generate random numbers.
            </p>

            <h3>Coding Process Difficulties</h3>
            <p>
                When initially coding Phase 1, before I discovered jQueryUI and its functions that I could use, I went through multiple iterations
                of code to achieve the effect of changing the shape. At first I was doing everything on a case by case basis; i.e, if the blue
                box was checked, and the object was red, then red would be removed from the class list, and blue would be added. This worked,
                but was tedious to do, and was inefficient with the amount of diferent options there would be; it also made adding new options later 
                much harder. My second iteration was to do a case by case removal of elements from the class list; i.e, if circle is checked
                when clicking square, remove circle from the list. Then, the target value would be added to the classlist at the end of the 
                function, regardless of what was removed. This worked better, but was hard, and not smooth. Implementing jQueryUI allowed for 
                the use of Switch Class, and made the transitions smooth. It still requires case by case switching, but it can be done in one line,
                making it fairly versatile. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Trying to genrate a complex SVG just from code is not an easy process, and I have fully come to realize that. When I initially
                thought about doing SVG following for one of my project pages, I had thought about just doing circles with variable radii, but I 
                thought that would look too boring, so I wanted to try something more. However, polygonal figures can vary greatly with their 
                smoothness, and can be quite difficult to predict. If I had not had a myriad of other projects to work on during this period, I
                would have liked to have made it so that the random SVG could be a circle, or a random polygon, and both would have random aspects
                to them. In the end, I moved from using a 'polygon' SVG to using a 'polyline'. This made the follwing a bit smoother, and allowed 
                for more variety in the shapes that would be produced, since they don't have to loop back to the initial point. I also wanted 
                try and implement the direct path following, like in the example on the anime.js documentation, but to do so would have required
                an immense amount of testing, and would not have been compatible with varying shape sizes, something which is core to this 
                experience. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When it came time to add Javascript to the Index page, I had a relatively clear idea of what I wanted: hovering over the 'title' text
                for each phase would prompt the user to click it, and doing so would reveal the information about it. As well, when the user clicked
                on another heading, the currently open one would close. After a few hours of testing, and multiple resets of the file, I realized 
                this ideal would not be met in the time constraints I had. For unknown reasons, the methods that I was using to implement this
                were not working, and would sometimes cause the page to buffer and break, even though I was running it locally. This occured for
                both the appearing/disappearing text that would prompt the user, as well as the text underneath; in attempts to do both, the 
                site would break. In the end, I decided to compromise, and at least add in the bottom text appearing, even if it is not as fliud
                or appealing as I would like.
