# 230-Project4
## Description 
For this project, I want to make something that is interesting. To start, the user will create a ‘piece’ of sorts, an object which they can change the size, shape, opacity, and color; for now, I am planning on having the options be a square, a circle, a triangle, and possibly other shapes if I have time. Once the user creates this, it will be saved, and used in the second and third interactions. 

The second interaction would involve the previously created shape, and a slider. The shape will start at a specific ‘launch’ point, and the slider will be underneath it. As the user drags the slider back, the shape will move as well, moving back from its initial point. At whatever place the user releases the slider, the shape will then be launched in the opposite direction it was being pulled, essentially like a slingshot. The further the slider was pulled back, the more elastic, and the further the shape will go. 

The third interaction utilizes a path-following algorithm along an SVG. This animation will likely also have full playback control, so it can be paused, played, and restarted. The SVG that the shape will follow will have some element of randomness to it, such as a random radius of a circle. If there is time, I may add the option to choose what shape is followed, or figure out how to make complex shapes be randomly generated.
