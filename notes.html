            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <h3>Primary Library</h3>
            <p>The main library that made this site possible is <a href="animejs.com">anime.js.</a> It is a library that revolves around animating 
            different elements on a page in smooth and unique ways. It is what allowed for the vanishing menus on Phase 1, the entirety of 
            Phase 2, as well as the path following and drawing on Phase 3.</p>

            <h3>Additional Libraries</h3>
            <p>I also implemented <a href="https://jqueryui.com/">jQueryUI</a>, a branch of <a href="jquery.com">jQuery</a>. JQueryUI allowed
            for smooth transitions between switching classes, as used on Phase 1; the Switch Class function of jQueryUI was incredibly helpful
            for that.</p>
            
            <h3>Tutorials/Code Utilized</h3>
            <p>The gradient lines were taken from these sites: https://css-tricks.com/forums/topic/sexy-css3-fading-line/ https://gist.github.com/tylergaw/2417036 https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp</p>
            <p>The styled sliders came from this W3 Schools https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp. This also helped guide
                me as to how to make slider input change the position of the shape in Phase 2.</p> 
            <p>SVG creation and workings came from Morten Rand-Hendriksen's tutorial on <a href="https://www.lynda.com/SVG-tutorials/Draw-polygon/622089/658126-4.html?org=rit.edu">Lynda.com</a></p>

            <h2>Above and Beyond</h2>
            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <p>Although we did an out of class exercise on local storage, I needed to relearn how to use it, as well as how to properly implement
                it. This is what allowed for the same shape to carry over between different pages, even between sessions. 
            </p>
            <p>Another obvious point of learning was the capabilities of anime.js. The documentation provided for the library is quite detailed,
                but testing was still necessary to figure out how to achieve desired animations and movements. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the harder parts of this project was learning how to do random generation of SVGs. We briefly learned how SVGs worked, but procedural,
                on the fly generation was not in that lesson. Morton Rand-Hendriksen's tutorial on Lynda.com talking about how to draw polygonal SVGs 
                is where I got most my information for this topic. This also involved getting a basic grasp of the Math class in JavaScript so I could
                generate random numbers.
            </p>

            <h3>Coding Process Difficulties</h3>
            <p>
                When initially coding Phase 1, before I discovered jQueryUI and its functions that I could use, I went through multiple iterations
                of code to achieve the effect of changing the shape. At first I was doing everything on a case by case basis; i.e, if the blue
                box was checked, and the object was red, then red would be removed from the class list, and blue would be added. This worked,
                but was tedious to do, and was inefficient with the amount of diferent options there would be; it also made adding new options later 
                much harder. My second iteration was to do a case by case removal of elements from the class list; i.e, if circle is checked
                when clicking square, remove circle from the list. Then, the target value would be added to the classlist at the end of the 
                function, regardless of what was removed. This worked better, but was hard, and not smooth. Implementing jQueryUI allowed for 
                the use of Switch Class, and made the transitions smooth. It still requires case by case switching, but it can be done in one line,
                making it fairly versatile. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Trying to genrate a complex SVG just from code is not an easy process, and I have fully come to realize that. When I initially
                thought about doing SVG following for one of my project pages, I had thought about just doing circles with variable radii, but I 
                thought that would look too boring, so I wanted to try something more. However, polygonal figures can vary greatly with their 
                smoothness, and can be quite difficult to predict. If I had not had a myriad of other projects to work on during this period, I
                would have liked to have made it so that the random SVG could be a circle, or a random polygon, and both would have random aspects
                to them.
