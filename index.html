            Welcome to Animation Station! 
            Here, you'll be able to make a shape and play around with it in various ways. 
            For the full experieince, start with Phase 1, and continue onto Phase 2 and 3. 
            Otherwise, you will be using a default shape, rather than one created by you!
            Click on the titles below to learn more, and get started!
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blockHold">
        <div class="block">
            <h2 id="p1Title">Phase 1</h2>
            <div class="blockText" id="p1">
                <p>
                    In Phase 1, you will create your own shape which you will use in Phases 2 and 3. Making a shape is easy! 
                    Use various options to create a shape you like, and then move onto Phase 2 and 3 to actually use it. Don't worry,
                    it will stay with you the whole time, even if you leave and come back!
                </p>
                <p>If you're ready, let's get started!</p>
                <button id="p1But"></button>
            </div>

        <div class="block">
            <h2 id="p2Title">Phase 2</h2>
            <div class="blockText" id="p2">
                <p>
                In Phase 2, you'll get to throw your shape around the screen! 
                Using a set of sliders, you'll be able to launch your shape, and watch it fly across the screen. 
                Be sure to try it with different sized shapes!
                </p>
            
                <button id="p2But"></button>

        <div class="block">
            <h2 id="p3Title">Phase 3</h2>
            <div class="blockText" id="p3">
                <p>
                    In Phase 3, you can sit back and watch your shape move. 
                    When the page loads, you will see an initial, random shape being drawn, and your shape will start moving with it!
                    You can change the shape, and watch it morph to something different, all while your shape follows off to the side!
